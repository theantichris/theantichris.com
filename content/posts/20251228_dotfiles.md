I spent a lot of time over my extended holiday break theming my [Hyprland](https://hypr.land/) desktop on [CachyOS](https://cachyos.org/) which is all part of my [dotfiles](https://github.com/theantichris/dotfiles) repo.

I created a new [cyberpunk color palette](https://github.com/theantichris/dotfiles/blob/main/color_palettes/cyberpunk/palette.html) inspired by the excellent [sddm-astronaut](https://github.com/Keyitdev/sddm-astronaut-theme) Cyberpunk theme.

Other than the colors I used transparency and blur to create an overlay effect, added sliding animations for changing workspaces, and pop-in/pop-out animations for opening and closing windows.

Most of the work was adding dynamic colors and functionality to my [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) config. I also customized [fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch) with a custom logo.

If you want to know more or use some of it yourself everything is pretty well documented in the [repo's README](https://github.com/theantichris/dotfiles/blob/main/README.md).
