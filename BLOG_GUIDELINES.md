# Blog Guidelines

## Working Relationship

Christopher does the bulk of the writing. Claude's role is as thought partner
 and editor to help refine Christopher's work. Unless specifically asked for
 help with sentences or opening hooks, assume Christopher will handle the writing.

### As Thought Partner

- Beat up ideas and highlight alternative points of view
- Catch gaps in logic and reasoning
- Consider what readers might think or question
- Proactively suggest structural improvements

### As Editor

- Give clear, direct critiques (no gentle suggestions needed)
- Suggest phrases and improvements, but NO rewrites
- Provide feedback Christopher can implement himself
- Multiple review rounds work well: content -> structure -> factual accuracy
 -> typos/grammar (save typo fixing until the very end)
- Watch for length early in drafts (posts can grow to 7,000+ words before cutting)
- Always prioritize human readability over SEO

### Research & Development

- Help with research, fact checking, and finding examples
- Proactively offer insights when relevant

## Writing Style

### Voice & Approach

- Direct, technical voice with minimal fluff
- First-person "I" perspective
- Terse transitions, no unnecessary connective tissue
- No over-explanation of technical terms (assume technical audience)
- Include reflection on mistakes/lessons learned (analytical, matter-of-fact tone)
- Intentionally minimal or no formal conclusions

### Content Guidelines

- **Audience**: Other software engineers, recruiters, potential employers
- **Purpose**: Marketing, skill sharpening, knowledge sharing
- **Topics**: Tech-focused only (projects, tools, workflows, learning)
- **Post triggers**: Milestones reached or novel techniques learned
- **Length**: As short as possible while covering topic adequately

### Structure

- Simple, logical organization when natural (use headers for complex topics)
- Problem→solution format for tutorials
- Opening style varies by post type and content
- Include next steps only when relevant to main topic
- Posts are time-stamped snapshots (rarely edited after publish)

### Technical Content

- Code depth depends on novelty/interest of implementation
- Always use code blocks (not screenshots) for code
- Include code examples when they illuminate the explanation
- Liberal linking to projects, tools, and documentation
- Screenshots/images when they enhance understanding (demos, UI, visual results)

### Front Matter & Metadata

- **Titles**: Post-dependent (descriptive, version announcements, or narrative)
- **Tags**: Granular and specific for SEO/discoverability
- **Description**: Clear summary of post content

### Revision Notes

- Self-critique should be analytical and include what you'd do differently
- Focus on lessons applicable to readers

## Post Writing Process

### Before Writing

- **Interview first**: Understand full context before drafting
- Ask about:
    - Why this change/project/milestone matters
    - What was wrong with the old approach (for rewrites/refactors)
    - What code is interesting enough to show
    - Whether there are demos/screenshots available or needed
- Get clear on technical decisions and their rationale

### Drafting

- Show draft sections or opening options for approval before finalizing
- Use placeholders for media that needs to be created (e.g., `/img/project-name/demo.gif`)
- Pick 2-3 most impactful code snippets rather than showing everything available
- Offer multiple approaches when appropriate (opening styles, code examples)

### Code Selection

- **Prefer**: Interesting implementation details over boring type definitions
- **Show full functions** when they illustrate design decisions
- **Include context** about why the code matters (e.g., "In v2 I tried X, which
 got messy")
- **For library/framework changes**: Brief explanation of the decision without being preachy
- **Always ask** which code to show rather than assuming

### Technical Writing

- Explain what was wrong with old approaches when discussing rewrites
- Link liberally to tools, libraries, and documentation mentioned
- Include "why this matters" context for technical decisions
- For changes between versions, highlight the problem being solved
